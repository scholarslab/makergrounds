                  <p>Mechatronics involves the synergistic integration of
                  Mechanical Engineering with electronics and intelligent
                  computer control in the design and manufacture of industrial
                  products and processes.</p>

                  <p>In UVA’s Mechatronics Lab, students fuse theory and
                  practice – bringing together principles of mechanical,
                  electrical, and software engineering. Here students learn how
                  to integrate microcontrollers, sensors, and smart actuators
                  when designing state-of-the-art mechanisms. The recent drop
                  in cost of embedded computer technology has revolutionized
                  the way that modern products are developed and manufactured.
                  The Mechatronics Lab ensures that UVA’s engineering students
                  are prepared to succeed on the cutting edge of technology.
                  For example, our current experiments teach students how to
                  program a microcontroller chip that houses eight, parallel,
                  32-bit processors, is capable of executing 200 million
                  instructions every second, and only costs about four dollars.
                  When students learn to incorporate this type of intelligence
                  into their machines, their devices come alive and are able to
                  automatically adapt to changes in their environment – that
                  is, they read data from sensors, think about it, and then
                  decide how to move their actuators to react to any changes.
                  In this lab, students are also introduced to basic circuit
                  components and measurement tools such as breadboards,
                  oscilloscopes, function generators, and digital multi-meters.
                  Students working on projects for their senior thesis work,
                  capstone design courses, ASME, Baja car, Hoos Flying, and
                  countless other creative outlets offered through the
                  University, frequently use the resources of this lab to help
                  bring their inventions to life.</p>
