                  <p>The Mcintire Department of Art is host to a little known
                  sculpture shop in Ruffin Hall. Beyond tradition- al
                  wood-working equipment the shop has a pneumatic stone carver,
                  sand blaster, Mig welders, and a bronze foundry. The shop
                  space is primarily used by sculpture students in the art
                  department to complete projects and produce shows, but other
                  students are welcome to be trained on the tools. Most
                  students are trained during class time, but TAâ€™s are
                  available outside of class hours.</p>

                  <p>The Ruffin Shop would like to collaborate with more
                  departments in the future on projects that will help make the
                  Arts more visible around Grounds. Like most shops, they are
                  looking for more space to house new tools, such as a joiner
                  and planar for reclaim wood re- processing. The shop is also
                  looking to acquire a lathe, a ring roller, a plate shear, and
                  a brake.</p>
