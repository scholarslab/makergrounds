                  <p>The Scene Shop in the Drama Department is primarily used
                  to produce the stage sets and props for performances. The
                  shop has tools for welding, woodworking, metal cutting, a hot
                  wire cutter, a hand held plasma cutter, a vacuum former, and
                  a paint frame that can rig up large projects. The shop
                  teaches workshops about welding, vacuum forming, rigging and
                  flying, OSHA, and Arduino micro controllers. There is also a
                  basketball hoop that takes advantage of the high ceilings.
                  All tools are accessible to students outside of the depart
                  ment who have had safety training. </p>
