                    Mark your calendars now. On Wednesday, April 15, 2020, from 1pm until 3:30pm is the first annual Spring Maker Showcase. Hosted by the Scholars' Lab Makerspace in Alderman Library, this event will give students and other makers at UVA the opportunity to showcase their projects, network with other makers on Grounds, and learn about all of the places and tools available for making on Grounds.

                <p>The FabLab at the School of Architecture is thrilled to open up our new space to our FabLab Friends from around Grounds.  We have some intro classes on Friday afternoons to start off the month of February!  Sign up is <a href="https://bookwhen.com/fablab">here on Bookwhen</a>.  We will have more short courses come March in 3D printing, sewing and CNC embroidering, CNC routing, and many other exciting topics!</p> 
                <p>If you cannot make that time or have another interest other than use of the woodshop or the lasers, please email us at <a href="mailto:fablab@virginia.edu">fablab@virginia.edu</a> and we will chat! </p>

                <h3>Drama and Scene Shop</h3>
                <p>We are looking for students who would be interested in joining our "robot team". Moving scenery around on stage out of sight of the audience is not as simple as it sounds on the surface. We are developing a robotic platform that is capable of moving up to 1,000lbs of scenery around the stage. The robot is based on the Raspberry Pi 4 and communicates with a server over a closed network. This project is in its second year of heavy development and we are looking for individuals to join the team and continue the work with us. There are multiple languages being used so familiarity with Python, C++, or JS are a plus. If you are interested in joining the team please email Chris Rybitski at <a href="mailto:cmr4gr@virginia.edu">cmr4gr@virginia.edu</a>.

                        Arduino Workshop Come learn about the Arduino micro-controller for fun or profit. No experience or equipment needed. Arduino kits and laptops provided to use in class, but you are welcome to bring your own. This workshop will go through the very basics of electricity, how to setup the Arduino, and building a first circuit; an LED nightlight. You can then spend the rest of the time working through the exercises at your own pace.

No experience with electronics or Raspberry Pi required for this workshop. Due to limitations of hardware, this workshop only has four open spots.

                <h3>Wilson Hall Maker Studio</h3>
                <p>I'm forming a Unity / 3D Design practice group. Mostly this will be a place to come and learn a quick thing or two about Unity / 3D Design practice (not about projects, per se) and then share challenges or ideas. Meeting schedule TBD, but probably monthly or bi-weekly depending on interest. It will be a pretty informal leaderless collective, and until it gathers momentum I'm happy to provide most of the content.
                </p>
 
                <p>
                An example meeting might have a topic like "Scriptable Objects: What, When Why". 10 - 15 minutes of teaching content, 30-45 on related or unrelated challenges from the group (e.g. "How would I best optimize my project for WebGL?") 
                </p>

                <p>
                This would be open to all levels. I added the "3D Design" aspect as well since we have some blossoming Blender experts on this list, and I want to pick their brains! If you know software and want to add it to the list, we can do that, although the group might subdivide depending on interests.
                </p>
