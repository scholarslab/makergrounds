                  <p>The 20,000-square-foot, four-story Lacy Hall was designed
                  and constructed to support the needs of students engaged in
                  experiential learning. The Ann Warrick Lacy Experiential
                  Center is located on the third and fourth floors of the
                  building. The third floor, which is at ground level, has
                  large open spaces and a front door large enough to
                  accommodate a vehicle. The fourth floor is divided into
                  various areas, in an open design specifically intended to
                  foster student interaction.</p>

                  <p>Programs and team activities that were previously
                  distributed throughout the Engineering School and elsewhere
                  are now gathered in the building, providing opportunities for
                  students from different teams to help each other in common
                  areas of technology. Students will have access to modern
                  machine tools, including rapid prototyping tools that support
                  the manufacture of parts and devices from computer
                  designs.</p>
